            <strong>Dennis MacAllistair Ritchie</strong> (1941-2011) was an
            American computer scientist most well known for his contributions
            to the C programming language and to the original UNIX at Bell Labs.
        </p><p>
            Ritchie began working at Bell Labs in 1967, where he helped develop
            UNIX with <a href="people/ken">Ken Thompson</a> and created the C
            programming language &mdash; a programming language used in almost
            every single modern computer system as the language used to build
            the <dfn>operating system</dfn>; the link between the
            <dfn>kernel space</dfn> and the <dfn>user space</dfn>.
        </p><p>
            Just as many modern operating systems have their roots in UNIX,
            quite a few modern programming languages use syntax and design
            elements first used in C. C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and many
            more have a large part of their syntax owed to C.
        </p><p>
            Ritchie has recieved numerous awards for his work on UNIX and C,
            but many non-computer people haven't realised his influence on
            the world as we know it. He died a mere week after the death of
            Steve Jobs, another important computing figure, but didn't
            recieve nearly as much attention.
