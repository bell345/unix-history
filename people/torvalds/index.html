            <strong>Linus Benedict Torvalds</strong> is a Finnish software
            developer known for developing the
            <a href="derivatives#linux">Linux kernel</a>, the most popular
            UNIX-based kernel used in <dfn title="GNU Project">GNU</dfn>/Linux,
            Android and Chrome OS. He also developed the Git version control
            system, increasingly popular amongst smaller software developers
            and used in the development of the Linux kernel.
        </p><p>
            After his mandatory stint in the Finnish Army, Linus attended
            the University of Helsinki in 1988. There, he read Andrew
            Tannenbaum's <em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em>,
            where he developed his love affair with UNIX. He titled his Master's
            thesis <em>Linux: A Portable Operating System.</em>
        </p><p>
            Ever since he was 11 years old, Linus programmed for the Commodore
            VIC-20, eventually writing his own assembler and Pac-Man clone.
            He recieved his first 80386 IBM PC clone in 1991, where he also got
            introduced to <a href="people/stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and the
            <dfn>GNU Project</dfn>. He released the first version of Linux later
            that year, and 1.0 in 1994.
        </p><p>
            He worked at Transmeta from 1997 until 2003, where he moved on to
            the Open Source Development Labs. The OSDL merged with the Free
            Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, who still employs
            him to be head maintainer of the Linux kernel. His role is mostly
            merging code written by millions of other individuals and corporate
            entities, e.g. Red Hat and Google.
