            <strong>Richard Matthew Stallman</strong> is a free software
            activist and computer programmer most well known for founding the
            <dfn>GNU Project</dfn> and the Free Software Foundation, efforts
            that promote the idea of copyleft; that uses copyright law to ensure
            that users are given many rights to software without them being
            taken away.
        </p><p>
            Stallman was inspired to vehemently pursue free software after a
            series of copyright issues with one of them being unable to modify
            the software on a Xerox 9700 to notify the campus of print jobs.
            In September of 1983, Stallman announced to the world his GNU
            Project, with the end goal of creating a completely free and
            open-source operating system based upon UNIX.
        </p><p>
            The GNU Project had almost all the parts of a fully-functioning
            operating system, but still lacked a decent kernel.
            <a href="people/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> created his own kernel
            using GNU tools, and soon it became the leading avenue for the GNU
            Project's software. Stallman prefers to call this system GNU/Linux,
            as he feels the short name, Linux, undermines the GNU Project and
            its work.
        </p><p>
            Stallman is extremely privacy concerned, and often takes and
            recommends drastic measures to protect it. For example, he doesn't
            own a mobile phone, as it enables easy government/malicious
            tracking, and he also doesn't fetch websites from his web browser:
            he has a remote server fetch them and send them to him securely.
