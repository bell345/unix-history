        <h1>Early Adoption of UNIX</h1>
        <div class="sidebar">

        <p>
            The first users of the growing UNIX system was <dfn title="bell-labs">Bell Labs'</dfn> internal departments on
            <abbr title="Digital Equipment Corporation"><dfn>DEC</dfn></abbr> computers, winning out over DEC's own operating system.
            Porting to other computers such as the Interdata 8/32, the UNIVAC 1100 and (later) an Intel 8086-based computer
            was much easier for UNIX since it was mostly written in <dfn>C</dfn>. Technically, any computer with a C compiler
            could run UNIX.
        </p><p>
            Adoption outside of the Labs was helped by an antitrust ruling in 1953 that stated that AT&amp;T must never
            enter the computer business. That meant that UNIX had to be distributed to anybody who asked because they couldn't
            sell it. The PDPs and other <dfn title="minicomputer">minicomputers</dfn> that UNIX ran on were far too expensive
            for regular users. There were no personal computers during the 1970s, mind you. But its prolific use in universities
            gave rise to the next generation of rebellious computer hackers &mdash; minicomputers were often not as regulated as
            the larger mainframes, and this led to a counterculture against <dfn>IBM</dfn> and
            corporate computing that persists to this day.
        </p><p>
            When Version 7 was released in 1979, UNIX had evolved from a small PDP-7 project to a complete system that spread
            to universities as far away as Australia (UNSW, to be precise). By the late 1970s, commercial UNIX developments
            started to take place &mdash; <abbr title="Santa Cruz Operation"><dfn>SCO</dfn></abbr> was the first company that
            sold UNIX commercially. Even a small <dfn title="Microsoft">Seattle software company</dfn> who had previously only
            made an Altair BASIC compiler began to sell a modified UNIX, rebranded as <a href="derivatives/xenix">XENIX</a>.
