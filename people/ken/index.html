            <strong>Kenneth Lane "Ken" Thompson</strong> is a computer science
            pioneer most well known for making the majority of UNIX along with
            <a href="people/dmr">Dennis Ritchie</a>. His other accomplishments
            include designing Plan 9 from Bell Labs, a research OS not unlike
            UNIX that didn't gain much popularity; designing the UTF-8 encoding,
            the foundation of modern information transmission; and co-designing
            the Go language at Google.
        </p><p>
            After obtaining a Master's in Electrical Engineering and Computer
            Science, Thompson worked at Bell Labs, where he designed UNIX along
            with Ritchie. He also contributed greatly to
            <dfn>regular expression</dfn>s, implementing them in his line editor
            <code>ed</code> and causing them to become popular, especially using
            his notation.
        </p><p>
            He continued to work on Research UNIX, and even installed it at
            Berkeley where he got his degree, where it turned into
            <a href="derivatives#bsd">BSD</a>. In 2000, after retiring from
            Bell Labs, he worked at Entrisphere, Inc. and now works at Google
            as a Distinguished Engineer, where he is co-designing the Go
            language.
