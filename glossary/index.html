            <dt id="c"><h3>C</h3></dt>
            <dd><p><strong>C</strong> is a popular <dfn>high-level programming language</dfn>.
                It is commonly used
                in environments where speed is key and control over many aspects of the program
                is needed. C is used in embedded systems and also in operating system design,
                most notable of which is the UNIX kernel.

            <dd><p>
                The <strong>command line interface</strong>, shortened to <strong>CLI</strong>, is a user interface
                that primarily uses the concept of commands typed on a screen to accomplish tasks. While CLIs can
                be non-intuitive, they can help massively with quick modification and complicated tasks that would
                otherwise be prohibitively difficult with a GUI that can be done with only a few commands with a CLI.

            <dt id="daemon"><h3>Daemon</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                In UNIX and UNIX-like systems, a <strong>daemon</strong> is a program that performs its duties
                in the background. They do not usually have <dfn>GUI</dfn>s, and usually provide
                interfaces from the hardware, firmware and operating system to
                <dfn>user-space</dfn> software.
            </p><p>
                The Windows equivalent is called a <strong>service</strong>.

            <dd><p>
                A <strong>GUI</strong> is a user interface that heavily utilises GPU-drawn graphics such as bitmapped images, shapes,
                and real-life metaphors such as icons in contrast of a <dfn>command-line interface</dfn> which uses only
                rows and columns of text drawn uniformly to a screen.

            <dt id="gnu-project"><h3>GNU Project</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                The <strong>GNU Project</strong> was founded by free software activist <a href="people/stallman">Richard Stallman</a>
                as a community effort to create a fully free and open-source operating system based upon UNIX. The GNU Project uses
                the GPL, a license which allows the end-user unlimited privileges to copy, modify and redistribute the software,
                and for any modifications to be licensed as openly. Currently, the most popular implementation of GNU tools is in
                <a href="derivatives#linux">GNU/Linux</a>, with the Linux kernel being seperate from the project but very much
                dependent on the tools provided by it.

            <dt id="high-level-programming-language"><h3>High-level programming language</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                High-level programming involves many structures and syntax that help the programmer
                to avoid dealing with the low-level aspects of the hardware and <dfn>operating system</dfn>.
            </p><p>
                Examples of high-level programming languages include C++, Java, Haskell and Python.

                MIT is an institute for higher learning that specialises in technological progress. MIT alumni
                have helped shape the worlds of technology and computer science.

            <dt id="monolithic"><h3>Monolithic</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                A <strong>monolithic</strong> application is one that performs all of the processes needed to
                complete a specific task and is self-contained (that is, doesn't use any other programs to carry
                out its function). Parts of a monolitic application cannot be used to complete other tasks.
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="multics"><h3>MULTICS</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                <strong>MULTICS</strong>, short for MULTiplexed Information and Computing Services, was an early
                collaborative effort by Bell Labs, General Electric and MIT to develop an efficient <dfn>time-sharing</dfn>
                system that could run on large mainframes. The project was later abandoned, and some engineers from Bell
                Labs who previously worked on Multics moved on to develop UNIX.
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="multi-user"><h3>Multi-user</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                A <strong>multi-user</strong> <dfn>operating system</dfn> is one that supports use by more than
                one computer user at one time. This is often acheived by remote login and/or multiple terminals.
                <dfn>Time-sharing</dfn> systems are multi-user systems.
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="operating-system"><h3>Operating system</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                An <strong>operating system</strong> is a collection of software that provides an interface between
                <dfn title="user-space">user</dfn> programs and the low-level hardware and firmware. The operating system
                handles a variety of tasks, including startup, shutdown, I/O, file system read/write, etc.
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="piping"><h3>Piping</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                <strong>Piping</strong> is a feature in command-line interfaces that allows the output from one program
                to be interpreted as the input to another program. It is called "piping" because the character that acheives
                this for many interfaces, starting with UNIX, is the vertical bar <kbd>|</kbd>, sometimes called a "pipe".
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="regular-expression"><h3>Regular expression</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                A <strong>regular expression</strong> is a string of text interpreted as a pattern. It uses
                metacharacters such as <code title="Start of a line">^</code> and <code title="End of a line">$</code> to represent
                places in the text and constructs such as
                <code title="Any character from A through Z">[A-Z]</code>,
                <code title="Zero or one of the previous">?</code> and
                <code title="One or more of the previous">+</code> to define the possible text strings that can fit the pattern.
            </p><p>
                Their syntax can be confusing at first, but their capabilities, combined with their wide adoption and use in <dfn>CLI</dfn>
                programs, makes them invalulable to programmers and power users.
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="time-sharing"><h3>Time-sharing</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                <strong>Time-sharing</strong>, when relating to computing, is where one computer hosts multiple users
                running different tasks at the same time. Time-sharing was utilised to take advantage of the free computer
                resources available when one particular user is not processing a task (e.g. when they are entering a command
                or away from the computer).
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="wildcard"><h3>Wildcard</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                The <strong>wildcard</strong> character (<kbd>*</kbd>) is used in many computer programs to represent a place
                where any string of text could reside, even the zero-length string (e.g. <code>*.html</code> could mean ".html",
                "a.html", "b.html", "ab.html", "bcc.html", etc.). Wildcard characters are a basic way to specify
                multiple strings of text through a string specification (see <dfn>regular expression</dfn>s for a more advanced
                method).
            </p></dd>

            <dt id="user-space"><h3>User space</h3></dt>
            <dd><p>
                <strong>User space</strong> is used to refer to programs run by the user of the computer voluntarily, as opposed
                to <dfn title="kernel-space">kernel space</dfn>, where basic programs such as drivers and interfaces run and
                interact with each other. It has been said by many, including <a href="people/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> (Linux
                kernel creator/maintainer) that it is imperative to keep these two categories of programs seperate.
