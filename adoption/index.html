        <h1>Early Adoption of UNIX</h1>
        <div class="sidebar">
        </div>
        <p>
            The first users of the growing UNIX system was <dfn title="bell-labs">Bell Labs'</dfn> internal departments on
            <abbr title="Digital Equipment Corporation"><dfn>DEC</dfn></abbr> computers, winning out over DEC's own operating system.
            Porting to other computers such as the Interdata 8/32, the UNIVAC 1100 and (later) an Intel 8086-based computer
            was much easier for UNIX since it was mostly written in <dfn>C</dfn>. Technically, any computer with a C compiler
            could run UNIX.
        </p><p>
            Adoption outside of the Labs was helped by an antitrust ruling in 1953 that stated that AT&amp;T must never
            enter the computer business. That meant that UNIX had to be distributed to anybody who asked because they couldn't
            sell it. The PDPs and other <dfn title="minicomputer">minicomputers</dfn> that UNIX ran on were far too expensive
            for regular users. There were no personal computers during the 1970s, mind you. But its prolific use in universities
            gave rise to the next generation of rebellious computer hackers &mdash; minicomputers were often not as regulated as
            the larger mainframes, and this led to a counterculture against <dfn>IBM</dfn> and
            corporate computing that persists to this day.
        </p><p>
            When Version 7 was released in 1979, UNIX had evolved from a small PDP-7 project to a complete system that spread
            to universities as far away as Australia (UNSW, to be precise). By the late 1970s, commercial UNIX developments
            started to take place &mdash; <abbr title="Santa Cruz Operation"><dfn>SCO</dfn></abbr> was the first company that
            sold UNIX commercially. Even a small <dfn title="Microsoft">Seattle software company</dfn> who had previously only
            made an Altair BASIC compiler began to sell a modified UNIX, rebranded as <a href="derivatives/xenix">XENIX</a>.
        </p><p>
            The success of UNIX was hindered in the early 1980s due to the fact that it didn't support the ARPANET network.
            Those sharing messages and files on this primordial Internet didn't see UNIX as powerful because it was limited in
            its networking capabilities. Adoption also had to be word-of-mouth, since AT&amp;T was forbidden from marketing it.
            This all changed when <abbr title="Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency"><dfn>DARPA</dfn></abbr> decided to
            implement the new <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol"><dfn>TCP/IP</dfn></abbr> stack on
            DEC VACs running Unix, simply because the source code for the <a href="derivatives/bsd">Berkeley distribution</a>
            was free and unencumbered.
        </p><p>
            At this point, there were a wide variety of divergent UNIX products from companies such as <dfn>SCO</dfn>,
            <dfn>Sun Microsystems</dfn> and <dfn>Microsoft</dfn>, although by 1981 they were working on a <dfn>CP/M</dfn>
            clone for <dfn>IBM</dfn>. UNIX only began to be sold by AT&amp;T when the US Department of Justice won a second
            anti-trust case against AT&amp;T, splitting the monopoly of the Bell System. But this led to an overruling of
            the 1958 decree that prohibited them from entering the computer industry, and they rushed to commercialise
            UNIX for themselves and release System V as a product.
        </p><p>
            Now that AT&amp;T started to market UNIX, some were initially optimistic. They saw this as a brilliant marketing
            opportunity for the operating system. But this was only the tip of the iceberg for the next several years of
            UNIX infighting and struggling to keep the dream of <a href="people/ken">Thompson</a> and <a href="people/dmr">Ritchie</a>
            alive.
