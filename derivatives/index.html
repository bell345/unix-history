            They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery. UNIX's success in the academic, and later commercial, fields spawned a wide array of
            UNIX imitators, built either on top of the source code distributed by Bell Labs, or reverse-engineered to replicate the features and functionality
            of UNIX. Some of these derivatives have even become certified as UNIX compatible systems, most notable of which is
            <a href="derivatives/osx">Mac OS X</a>, certified to bear the UNIX trademark ever since OS X Leopard (10.5).

            Another slang term for UNIX derivatives, or UNIX-like systems, is "*nix". The asterisk is used in programming contexts as a <dfn>wildcard</dfn> character (that
            is, it matches against any character) as a reference to the names of many UNIX-like systems, such as AIX, <a href="derivatives/hp-ux">HP-UX</a>,
            <a href="derivatives/irix">IRIX</a>, <a href="derivatives/linux">Linux</a> and <a href="derivatives/xenix">Xenix</a>. Here are a few examples of famous
            UNIX derivatives:

                    BSD was one of the first derivatives, based off of the original Bell Labs source code and first developed by the
                    <abbr title="Computer Systems Research Group">CSRG</abbr> of the University of California, Berkeley, beginning in 1977.
                    Development of the original BSD terminated in 1995; however, forks of the BSD system have gained popularity and are still
                    being used today. Some of the more popular ones include:

                        <h3><a href="derivatives/freebsd">FreeBSD</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            The most popular fork of BSD is FreeBSD, engineered to be an open-source general operating system intended for use
                            in a wide variety of fields. FreeBSD started development as 386BSD, an open-source release of BSD for Intel 80386
                            processors. Development was slow, so the developers branched out and created FreeBSD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to its popularity, you'll find FreeBSD code in a hell of a lot of places, including <a href="derivatives/osx">Mac OS X</a>;
                            on many, if not most, servers on the Internet; and even the operating system on board the PlayStation 3 and 4 gaming consoles.

                            OpenBSD is another open-source fork of BSD, but has found its niche in becoming one of the most robust security-focused
                            operating systems available. Its developers have a long history of scouring code for security bugs and releasing portable
                            systems, such as OpenSSH and OpenNTPD, that have a wide range of uses and are very security-conscious.

                        <h3><a href="derivatives/netbsd">NetBSD</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            NetBSD is one of the first forks of BSD. Despite being not that popular, NetBSD has found major use in embedded systems due to its
                            superior portability and compatibility, and is a common base for creating new processor architectures. As a side note, OpenBSD
                            is actually a fork of NetBSD, which in turn is a fork of BSD, which is a fork of UNIX. Crazy stuff, right?
