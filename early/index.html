        <h1>The Early History of UNIX</h1>

        <p>
            UNIX's inspiration came from Multics - an early <dfn>time-sharing</dfn> system developed from 1964 &mdash; 1969 by <dfn>MIT</dfn>, General Electric and
            <dfn>Bell Labs</dfn>. Multics is actually an acronym, standing for <strong>MULTI</strong>plexed <strong>I</strong>formation and
            <strong>C</strong>omputing <strong>S</strong>ervices. Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics project in 1969, and the Bell Labs developers working on the project were without
            something to do, <a href="people/ken">Ken Thompson</a> and <a href="people/dmr">Dennis Ritchie</a> among them. Thompson and Ritchie began work
            on another operating system to bide their time - a replacement for Multics on the compact PDP-7 mainframe computer. One wise-cracking colleague
            suggested it be called the <strong>UN</strong>iplexed <strong>I</strong>formation and <strong>C</strong>omputing <strong>S</strong>ervices; it
            was similar to Multics, but with less power and for smaller machines. UNICS, later changed to UNIX, was the name that stuck.
        </p><p class="note">
            <strong>Did you know?: </strong> UNIX was first developed to host a game that Thompson wrote called
            <cite><a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~lib215/reference/history/spacetravel.html">"Space Travel"</a></cite> that was originally written
            for the GE-645, but development was hampered by its price ($75/hour!). A dusty PDP-7 laying around was picked up by Thompson, and then saw the need
            for a compact operating system for the PDP-7 in order to run his game.

            UNIX is based upon a more simple and modular philosophy that was very different from other mainframe systems of the time. Thompson and Ritchie aimed
            to create an operating system based around a large collection of software tools that perform one task, as opposed to <dfn>monolithic</dfn> applications
            that handle a variety of tasks and may share the same internal functions. Another core part of the philosophy was <dfn>piping</dfn> - using the output
            of one program as the input of another - an example is using the commands that print the text content of a file (<code>cat file.txt</code>) and finds all
            lines that start with A (<code>grep -E "^A"</code>) and piping the inputs as so: <code>cat file.txt | grep -E "^A"</code>.
        </p><p>
            The first real test of UNIX came when the text formatting utilities of the system were beginning to be used by AT&amp;T's patent department. It was a huge
            success for the patent examiners and the UNIX developers, as they now had greater credibility to purchase a more powerful PDP-11. All these new programs
            required a new form of documentation;
            The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on the 3rd of November 1971, and included command documentation written in the "man page" format &mdash;
            terse, descriptive summaries of the commands, their arguments, what they do, and the programmer's contact details; all interactively provided
            inside UNIX itself by typing <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code>. As UNIX was in constant
            development, many people simply described the version of UNIX as the version of The UNIX Programmer's Manual that was written for it.
        </p><p>
            The first edition of UNIX had a number of innovative features, one in particular that we all now take for granted &mdash; a <em>hierarchical file system</em>.
            This meant that files could now be sorted into directories, which could also contain other directories. At the time, file names could only be six characters
            large, but this was seen as plenty enough. Another innovative idea was to rewrite the entirety of UNIX in <dfn>C</dfn>, a <dfn>high-level programming language</dfn>.
            Operating systems were previously written only in assembly code, which was non-portable, verbose and very hard to remix and develop. Solving that problem
            by expressing it in a language that many considered didn't offer the control that operating systems required was a big deal at the time, and UNIX derivatives
            are still written in C today.
