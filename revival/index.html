        <p>
            By 1987, there were a variety of tools and standards falling into place that would set the scene for a revolution
            in the UNIX computing space. <a href="people/wall">Larry Wall</a> had created the <code>patch</code> utility, which
            could apply incremental changes to code files and enabled better collaboration on open-source programs. The GNU
            Project bore fruit, with a compiler, editor and debugger already fully developed and licensed under the GPL, which
            requires commercial bodies which use them to commit their changes back to the open-source community.
        </p><p>
            Speaking of GUIs, the <dfn>X windowing system</dfn> had started to become common on UNIX-likes, ushering in
            the new era of user-friendliness and graphical designs that the 90s was about to place in the minds of nearly
            everyone, even those previously not acclimated with computers.

            In 1990, there came a new project to port <a href="derivatives#bsd">BSD</a> to the Intel 386, the dominant
            microprocessor in PCs. It was inspired by a desire to clean out from BSD all of the proprietary <dfn>AT&amp;T</dfn>
            code and create a fully free BSD. The project was encumbered when the creator of the project, William Jolitz, walked
            out on his own project, perhaps agitated that the commercial sponsors wanted to sell it instead of letting it be
            free.
        </p><p>
            August 1991 saw the very first public release of <a href="derivatives#linux">Linux</a>, a ground-up implementation
            of UNIX built with <dfn>GNU</dfn> tools. The creator, <a href="people/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>,
            is on record for stating that the main reason he created Linux was because of the prohibitive cost of
            <dfn title="Sun Microsystems">Sun's</dfn> UNIX. This UNIX-like appeared faster than 386BSD, and was not hampered by a lawsuit from
            AT&amp;T regarding proprietary source code.
        </p><p>
            The rise of the Internet also saw the rise of the open-source movement, and with it, the attitude that code should be shared,
            not sold. Linux, with help from an ever-growing repertoire of open-source hackers, soon became capable of TCP/IP and X Windows.
            Linux was faster, more reliable, more quickly updated and infinitely cheaper than any other commercial UNIX offering &mdash; the
            writing was on the wall for <dfn>SCO</dfn>, <dfn>SGI</dfn> and classical UNIX. The transition could be said to have been completed
            in 2000, when SCO sold its UNIX distribution to Caldera, a Linux distributor.
