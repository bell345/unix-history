            They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery. UNIX's success in the academic, and later commercial, fields spawned a wide array of
            UNIX imitators, built either on top of the source code distributed by Bell Labs, or reverse-engineered to replicate the features and functionality
            of UNIX. Some of these derivatives have even become certified as UNIX compatible systems, most notable of which is
            <a href="derivatives#osx">Mac OS X</a>, certified to bear the UNIX trademark ever since OS X Leopard (10.5).

            Another slang term for UNIX derivatives, or UNIX-like systems, is "*nix". The asterisk is used in programming contexts as a <dfn>wildcard</dfn> character (that
            is, it matches against any character) as a reference to the names of many UNIX-like systems, such as AIX,
            <a href="derivatives#irix">IRIX</a>, <a href="derivatives#linux">Linux</a> and <a href="derivatives#xenix">Xenix</a>. Here are a few examples of famous
            UNIX derivatives:

                    BSD was one of the first derivatives, based off of the original Bell Labs source code and first developed by the
                    <abbr title="Computer Systems Research Group">CSRG</abbr> of the University of California, Berkeley, beginning in 1977.
                    Development of the original BSD terminated in 1995; however, forks of the BSD system have gained popularity and are still
                    being used today. Some of the more popular ones include:

                        <p>
                            The most popular fork of BSD is FreeBSD, engineered to be an open-source general operating system intended for use
                            in a wide variety of fields. FreeBSD started development as 386BSD, an open-source release of BSD for Intel 80386
                            processors. Development was slow, so the developers branched out and created FreeBSD.

                        <p>
                            Due to its popularity, you'll find FreeBSD code in a hell of a lot of places, including <a href="derivatives#osx">Mac OS X</a>;
                            on many, if not most, servers on the Internet; and even the operating system on board the PlayStation 3 and 4 gaming consoles.

                            OpenBSD is another open-source fork of BSD, but has found its niche in becoming one of the most robust security-focused
                            operating systems available. Its developers have a long history of scouring code for security bugs and releasing portable
                            systems, such as OpenSSH and OpenNTPD, that have a wide range of uses and are very security-conscious.

                        <p>
                            NetBSD is one of the first forks of BSD. Despite being not as popular as its siblings, NetBSD has found major use in embedded systems due to its
                            superior portability and compatibility, and is a common base for creating new processor architectures. As a side note, OpenBSD
                            is actually a fork of NetBSD, which in turn is a fork of BSD, which is a fork of UNIX. Crazy stuff, right?

                    Mac OS X, despite bearing the Macintosh name, bares no resemblance to earlier Macintosh operating systems. OS X runs on Intel x86
                    as opposed to the PowerPC of Mac OS 8/9. It is based upon an open UNIX-based kernel named Darwin, which itself is based upon work
                    on the NeXT operating system acquired by Apple in the 1990s. Mac OS X provides a user-friendly consumer package along with its iMacs
                    for the untrained user, but also provides a traditional BSD-style terminal interface.

                    Linux was developed in August 1991 as a ground-up implementation of UNIX by Finnish university student
                    <a href="people/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>. Ever since then, the proliferation of the Internet has
                    enabled a global community of kernel contributors to create a reliable, dependable and commonplace system
                    which can be customised in any number of ways.
                </p><p>
                    The operating system has seen widespread use in infrastructure for web servers (70-98%, depending on estimates),
                    embedded hardware and supercomputers (485 out of the Top 500). Linux is almost never compiled from source: instead,
                    most users install a precompiled Linux with a bundled set of software packages; a Linux distribution. Here are a few
                    interesting Linux distributions:

                        <p>
                            Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution, known for its simple install process
                            and its large community of users to solve any problems a new Linux user might have.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are bountiful different derivatives of Ubuntu available, whose differentiating factor
                            is normally the desktop environment used. Ubuntu itself uses Unity, which bares some semblance
                            with <a href="derivatives#osx">Mac OS X</a>. Here is a quick list of Ubuntu derivatives:

                            Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is an unconventional Linux distribution, as Red Hat is a commercial
                            product while still providing all of its source code publicly. The way that it works is that Red Hat
                            makes money off of support and providing a secure package to enterprise users. The community counterpart,
                            Fedora, is available for free and is affiliated with Red Hat themselves.

                            distributions &mdash; it instead provides documentation on how to do it yourself.

                <p>
                    The first version of this UNIX derivative was released as Sun UNIX, later SunOS, in 1982, by <dfn>Sun Microsystems</dfn>.
                    In 1993, SunOS 5.x was renamed to Solaris. Solaris is well-known for its scalabilty on many different architectures and
                    its developments, such as the ZFS file system and DTrace. In 2005, Solaris was released under an open-source license
                    as OpenSolaris, but when <dfn>Oracle</dfn> acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, they reverted to a proprietary purchased model.

                    IRIX was a high-performance operating system based on System V UNIX by Silicon Graphics for its workstations. The operating
                    system saw popular use in special effects for movies, 3D animation and simulation, and various scientific uses. IRIX might be
                    most recognisable in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, where it ran on the fictitious dinosaur park's maintenance systems. The graphical
                    file manager <code>fsn</code> was also featured in these scenes, where it was sometimes ruled off as too unrealistic.

                <p>
                    Since AT&amp;T couldn't sell UNIX themselves due to an antitrust ruling at the time, they licensed it to Microsoft and other
                    vendors. Microsoft, in turn, decided to sell Xenix to other vendors, which would make their own proprietary versions for their
                    own architectures. Microsoft's Xenix originally only ran on PDP-11s like the original, but was soon ported to the Zilog Z8001
                    and then to x86. The product proved to be a big success for Microsoft, with Xenix being the most used UNIX variant during the
                    mid-to-late 1980s. Of course, Xenix was discontinued when AT&amp;T overturned the ruling and Microsoft, deciding that they couldn't
                    compete. They later sold the rights to <dfn>SCO</dfn>, who then turned it into SCO UNIX.

                <p class="note">
                    <strong>Did you know: </strong> Microsoft once thought that Xenix would be the way of the future; even delibrately holding back
                    on more advanced features of MS-DOS, such as multi-user abilities, because they billed Xenix as the higher-end option and would
                    eventually merge the two into XEDOS, basically MS-DOS with a bunch of extensions that would make it indistinguishable from Xenix.
