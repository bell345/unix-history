        <p>
            When AT&amp;T moved into the UNIX market, two things were beginning to take shape.
            One, the first round of UNIX infighting, often referred to as the UNIX Wars, and
            two, Intel microprocessors (specifically the 386) started to become powerful enough to run UNIX on personal
            machines. This not only meant that UNIX could become even more widespread, but it also
            meant that workstation vendors, such as <dfn title="sun-microsystems">Sun</dfn> and
            <dfn>SCO</dfn> had a much easier job of making the perfect UNIX workstation.
        </p><p>
            The fighting over System V (AT&amp;T) and <a href="derivatives#bsd">BSD</a> stemmed
            from the different cultures of the two platforms. BSD hackers were more free and
            anti-authority than those working on SysV, which they saw as backwards and bogged
            down by corporate mess. There were also technical disputes; over the networking APIs
            (streams vs. sockets) for example.
        </p><p>
            Efforts to unify the competing UNIX standards began in earnest with the 1985 <dfn>POSIX</dfn>
            standards, which made executive decisions on the functionality of a standardised UNIX. For example,
            Berkeley sockets were preferred over SysV streams, but SysV terminal controls were preferred over
            BSD tty. All derived UNIXes coming after adhered to these standards to some extent, which helped
            to quell the current UNIX disputes.

            <img src="assets/img/stallman.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman" />
            <figcaption>Richard Stallman is known for being a fervent open-source activist and founder of the GNU Project.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In 1985, <a href="people/stallman">Richard Stallman</a> founded the <dfn>GNU Project</dfn>,
            with an end goal of creating a fully open and free operating system from the ground-up. And
            in the beginning, although many people shared some of his ideals, he was never taken too
            seriously around the likes of <dfn>IBM</dfn>, Sun and AT&amp;T, who were the epitome of <dfn>proprietary</dfn>
            commercial giants and who ruled the computer market.
        </p><p>
            Speaking of IBM, in 1986, they made a fatal decision that caused them to back out of the
            PC market. OS/2 and the machines it ran on, while gaining a foothold in the point-of-sale
            market, never took off in the personal computer market, partly due to the fact that it ran
            on older 286 processors instead of the newer 386. Compaq managed to outmode them and provide
            the first UNIX-capable personal computer with a 386, despite the 16 MHz clock speed.
        </p><p>
            Make no mistake, IBM's previous standard, the soon-to-be-ubiquitous IBM PC still posed a massive
            threat to the UNIX industry. Especially from Microsoft, which had grown from a Seattle podunk startup
            to a major player in the software market with their flagship, MS-DOS. The following decade revealed a
            new card up Microsoft's sleeves: Microsoft Windows 3.0, which made the <dfn>GUI</dfn> a standard interface
            and cemented their influence on the computing industry.
